/** Holds the state flags for an AMQP endpoint.
 *
 * A pn_state_t is an integral value with flags that encode both the
 * local and remote state of an AMQP Endpoint (@link pn_connection_t
 * Connection @endlink, @link pn_session_t Session @endlink, or @link
 * pn_link_t Link @endlink). The local portion of the state may be
 * accessed using ::PN_LOCAL_MASK, and the remote portion may be
 * accessed using ::PN_REMOTE_MASK. Individual bits may be accessed
 * using ::PN_LOCAL_UNINIT, ::PN_LOCAL_ACTIVE, ::PN_LOCAL_CLOSED, and
 * ::PN_REMOTE_UNINIT, ::PN_REMOTE_ACTIVE, ::PN_REMOTE_CLOSED.
 *
 * Every AMQP endpoint (@link pn_connection_t Connection @endlink,
 * @link pn_session_t Session @endlink, or @link pn_link_t Link
 * @endlink) starts out in an uninitialized state and then proceeds
 * linearly to an active and then closed state. This lifecycle occurs
 * at both endpoints involved, and so the state model for an endpoint
 * includes not only the known local state, but also the last known
 * state of the remote endpoint.
