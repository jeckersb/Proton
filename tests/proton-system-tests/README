Contains the Proton system tests, which are written in Java but can be
used to test either the Java or C implementations.

To run the tests from a clean checkout:

* If you want to test proton-c, build it using the instructions in ./proton-c/README
* run "mvn test -P proton-c" or "mvn test -P proton-j"
